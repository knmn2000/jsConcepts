### setTimeout + Closures Interview Question üî• | Namaste üôè JavaScript Ep. 11
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBTBG4nda2A&ab_channel=AkshaySaini
```javascript
for (var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(j);
  }, 0);
}
//output-> 5 5 5 5 5

function x() {
  for (var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
    var i = 0;
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(i++);
    }, 0);
  }
  // output -> 0 1 2 3 4
  // this happened because js doesnt wait
  // for the settimeout to finish
  // all the settimeouts were stored somewhere else
  // and the loop continued as normal
  // at the end of the loop there were 5 setTimeouts
  // all of these timeouts had a refernce to the
  // variable i -> forming a closure with its env
  // now all the timedout functions will execute,
  // increasing the value of i.
}
//x();

function y() {
  for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(j);
    }, 0);
  }
  // using let instead of var solves the issue
  // let has a blockscope
  // everytime the loop runs, theres a new j variable each time
  // its not refering to the same thing at each loop
  // so each setTimeout function refers to different functions
}
//y();

//SOLUTION WITHOUT LET
function y() {
  for (var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
    function closure(j) {
      setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(j);
      }, 0);
    }
    closure(j);
  }
  //here the function closure gets the values of j by
  //value and not by reference, hence its basically a
  //new variable.
  //closure() forms a closure with this new variable,
  //and that is what is stored in memory by setTimeout.
  //output-> 0 1 2 3 4
}
y();

//behind the scenes:

var x = 1;
a();
b();
console.log(x);

function a() {
  var x = 10;
  console.log(x);

function b() {
  var x = 100;
  console.log(x);
}

// output
// 10
// 100
// 1

/* 
in the execution context-> memory will be allocated to x, a and b
x will hold undefined 
a and b will hold their function code

this global execution context will be pushed to the call stack

in the code, when the function a() is called, an execution context will be made for it
and this execution context will be stored inside its parent's execution context

it will also have a memory and a codesection, it will also have 
a variable x with memory allocated to it, and it will hold "undefined" 
in the beginning. 

this new execution context will be pushed to the callstack

during the execution of a()'s code, its variable x will get its value allocated to it.
Now, the console log inside function a() will look for the variable x in the 
local execution context.

after execution of a(), the whole execution context of a() will be deleted, 
and popped from the callstack. 

now b() will be called. the same steps as above will be followed 
create execution context within the global execution context ->
memory will be allocated to x -> value be allocated to x -> x will be console logged 
-> x will be found in the local exec context -> this execution context will be deleted and 
popped out of the stack.

finally the console log after the function calls will be executed, 
it will look for variable x and it will find x in the global execution context

now theres nothing more to execute, so finally the global execution context 
will be deleted, and be popped out of the call stack

//SHORTEST JS Program üî•window & this keyword | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 5

/*
whenever a js program is run a global object(window), global exec context,
and a "this" variable is created. 

wherever js runs, theres a js engine running along with it. 
chrome as v8, etc etc. 

in case of browsers, this obj is called "window".
its created even if the JS file is empty 

at global level
this===window is true 

what is global space?
any code that we write, that is not inside any function


*/

var a = 10;
function b() {
  var x = 10;
}
console.log(window.a);
console.log(a);
console.log(this.a);
// ouput
// 10
// 10
// 10
